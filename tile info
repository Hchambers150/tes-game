check each row for connected sprites that are the same
increase skip, increase tile count

266 REAL tiles -> 103 REAL tiles!!!

if it is not air, check the next tile to see if it is the same.
if it is the same, check the next tile.

tile.jumpPad(xPOS, height-y*h-h/2, w, h, height-y*h-h*0.87)

var c = createSprite(xPOS, height-y*h-h/2, w, h);
c.shapeColor = color(210, 50, 50);
var d = createSprite(xPOS, height-y*h-h*0.87, w, h/4);
d.shapeColor = color(255);
collideG.add(c);
allsprites.add(c);
allsprites.add(d);

// player notice conditions:

- "Noise"
- distance
- sprint on / off
- stealth on / off
- level day / night
- line of sight


// enemy types;

Nimble:
 - Always sprints (slightly slower than player's (if good AI))
 - 2 intelligence
 - lower damage

 Normal:
 - Might sprint?
 - 3 intelligence
 - normal damage

 Brute:
 - Doesn't sprint
 - 1 int

Enemy pathfinding methods:
so the enemy can ALWAYS know where the player is, and is always prepared to move to the Player
but the enemy will only move to the player when the player has been noticed by the specific enemy

the enemy can be prepared by just doing the subtractions from both player and enemy positions
on the x and y axis

pros: easy
cons: can't go around obstacles

ai is HARD they cant actually expect us to do that??

https://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/ -> trace -> chebyshev

make fake obstacles for only the enemy to collide with to make the enemy run up the wall
if there is a gap of more than a few blocks in front of it, always jump
it should favour taking the highest possible route
